## The Words Written in Front & About The Beautiful World

This used to be a test repository, and now it is, and it will be. Please go to other repository for other content.  

**The Beautiful World** firstly appeared in my diary as the title, which built a beautiful fictional world inspired by the real world. In terms of its stories, they happened in the real world, however, they turned out the perfect world we sought.

After that, it is more like a symbol of me. My Minecraft server named **The Beautiful World**, all the things have to do with me also have something to do with **The Beautiful World**. 

In my inner world, **The Beautiful World** has already been a virtual world. There fills my happiness and sadness, carrying my sweet memories. There are all my beloved things. I am currently in adolescence and have many unique feelings and emotions within me, I need to relieve excessive pressure on oneself. The fictional world  greatly helped me out. This is a beautiful place, but it is not empty. There will always be my best friend here.
